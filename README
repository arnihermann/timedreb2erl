This document describes how to get the `timedreb2erl` tool up and running.

Follow the rest of this document in order to produce an executable file.

All commands should be executed from the project root, i.e. the directory this
README file lies in.

Requirements
============

+ GHC >= 6.12
+ cabal >= 1.8
+ McErlang

McErlang is required to be able to simulate the generated Erlang code.

Install
=======

> cabal install 

And now we have a fresh binary `timedreb2erl` in our cabal bin directory.

Usage
=====

Given a timed rebeca model, we can generate Erlang source code for the model
such that we can simulate it with McErlang.

> timedreb2erl --genmodel --genrecords --genrun --genmonitor --outputdir=out simulation FILE

The `--genmodel` flag creates an Erlang file which corresponds to the model in
Timed Rebeca.

The `--genrecords` flag creates an Erlang header file which contains the
records that are used by the model (known rebecs, state variables, local
variables).

The `--genrun` flag creates a 'run' file which can be used by McErlang to
simulate the model.

The `--genmonitor` flag creates a template monitor file for you, the developer,
to edit such that McErlang fails on illegal state.
