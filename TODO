+ Create data types for Erlang as a target language (generated output is typeless) or alternatively, use Core.Erlang package
+ Implement translation which uses local time (this is partially done, in module Generator.Discrete which should be renamed to e.g. LocalTime)
+ Add usage example after generation for executing McErlang to README
+ Add some type checking
+ Finish some program transformations before translation to Erlang (e.g. var opassign exp, x += 1 does not work)
+ Write a translation for properties (some kind of predicates, ltl/ctl won't work for now)
